# Merge requests
Feel free to create merge requests, if the organisation deems it fit for inclusion, it will be merged without hesitation.

If your merge request is deemed unfit, the merge request will remain open for ease-of-access but marked with a label.

## Merge guidelines
- 1 file per commit (preferably underscores "_" instead of spaces in file names - it is allowed but frowned upon - thanks Microsoft ðŸ˜œ)
- Commit name: [name][year][if applicable, DOI identifier]
- Commit description: [name][year][if applicable, DOI identifier] + authors + public domain url (e.g. sci-hub.se, sci-hub.ru)

This makes it easy for others to find the correct file by navigating the commit history, and alleviates the burden of renaming the file to something long.

Please provide a virustotal link of which the SHA256 matches the file and the first date of upload is more than 3 weeks old. 

You may submit earlier but it will not be merged before then. 

Does not apply to txt and source code files. Does apply to zips, rars, jars, pdfs, docs. Do not submit executables. Do not submit repositories without a license, submit a txt file with links in it instead (origin, optionally web archive, mirror(s)).
